# dns-recon
This is mostly a modification of my people-recon tool. This project is for those who could use a lightweight tool to gather intelligence on a site.  There is room for improvement, and the sites included are not the most robust/detailed, however, the purpose of this tool was mainly to practice bash scripting for penetration testing purposes.
