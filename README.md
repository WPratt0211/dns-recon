# DNS Recon

**DNS Recon** is a bash script designed to provide a lightweight and practical solution for gathering intelligence on a target website by querying its DNS records. This tool is aimed at individuals looking to enhance their skills in bash scripting for penetration testing purposes.

## Purpose

DNS Recon is a derivative of the "People Recon" tool, which focuses on gathering intelligence on individuals using their first and last names. This DNS Recon tool, on the other hand, shifts its focus to web domains. It offers an uncomplicated method to query and retrieve DNS information from target websites. While it may not offer the most extensive or detailed data, it serves as a valuable exercise for those interested in bash scripting and penetration testing.

## Usage

### Prerequisites

Before using the DNS Recon tool, ensure that you have the necessary dependencies and permissions to perform DNS queries. This typically includes a Unix-like operating system with bash and access to standard DNS resolution tools.

### Running the Tool

To initiate a DNS reconnaissance scan on a target website, use the following syntax:

```
./dns-recon.sh
```

The script will then ask for the site that you wish to run the scan on. Once you provide the site, the scan will begin.

## Acknowledgments

This tool project was inspired by the "People Recon" tool, and its development aims to provide a simplified method for DNS reconnaissance. While there is room for further enhancement and refinement, the DNS Recon tool offers a practical exercise for bash scripting and penetration testing enthusiasts.

**Please note that using this tool should be done responsibly and only on websites and domains for which you have explicit permission to perform DNS reconnaissance. Unauthorized scanning can violate legal and ethical standards.**
